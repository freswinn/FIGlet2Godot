description="REQUIRES PRIOR INSTALLATION OF FIGLET
FIGlet is a piece of software used to create ASCII word art, and has been around in one form or another since 1991. Find more information here: http://www.figlet.org

This plugin has two main features:
1. It provides a way of getting the output from your system's installation of FIGlet into Godot efficiently in a way that can be called by your project. NOTE: Users of your project would then need to have FIGlet installed as well.
2. It provides a way to quickly insert ASCII word art into your scripts for easier readability, for example as headers for sections and for finding those sections in the preview thumbnail of your script."
